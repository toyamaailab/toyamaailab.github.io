To achieve its better performance for solving problems, six learning algorithms are for the first time used to train it. The experiments on 14 different problems involving classification, approximation, and prediction are conducted by using a multilayer perceptron and the proposed DNM. The results suggest that the proposed learning algorithms are effective and promising for training DNM and thus make DNM more powerful in solving classification, approximation, and prediction problems.",

Performance of complex-valued DNM (CDNM) is evaluated through a complex XOR problem, a non-minimum phase equalization problem, and a real-world wind prediction task. Also, a comparative analysis on a set of elementary transcendental functions as an activation function is implemented and preparatory experiments are carried out for determining hyperparameters. The experimental results indicate that the proposed CDNM significantly outperforms real-valued DNM, complex-valued multi-layer perceptron, and other complex-valued neuron models.",

In comparison with the traditional feedforward network model, MDPN focused on the importance of a single neuron and redefined the function of each subcomponent. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed MDPN on 16 standardized image datasets.",
